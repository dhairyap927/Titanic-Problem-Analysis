# Titanic-Problem-Analysis
This dataset typically includes information about the passengers, such as their age, sex, class, cabin, fare, and whether or not they survived. Analysis is done on the basis of these factors to know who is safest on the ship. 


EXECUTION STEPS:

1. Data Exploration: Started by loading and exploring the dataset. Investigated the available features, their types, and their distributions. This helped me gain insights into the data.

2. Excel : Using excel and pivot tables to track meaningful insights on basis of various factors like sex, class of travelling, age etc. and get a clearer picture of the data for better understanding of the trend

3. Data Visualization: Used visualization tool Tableau to make pictorial representation of data such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots, to better understand the relationships between different features and the survival outcome. This help identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.

4. Data Evaluation : Evaluated the discovered trends and correlation to draw conclusion and presented the conclusion along with a dashboard that summarized the key points and trends.
